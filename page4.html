            The wise old elf known as Landalore deals in the arcane, his magic spells are traditional,
             Arcane blast, Arcane Strike, polymorphes, conjurations of water and food,
             and of course blink the effect to teleport to any location, along with blink the elf has
             learned to cast portals to other dimensions allowing him to travel across Azeroth with ease.
</div>
             <div class="july2">
               Higher ranking spells like cataclysm, ignite and fireball are also a must have for any mage so obviously the old elf has it in his breadth of knowledge.

 Along his travels in the depths of the the Temple of Ahn’Qiraj (an ancient palace hidden in the desert of Silithus) the mage found a resting old god known in their tongue as C’Thun a massive eye with tendrils and radiating old magic the likes of which he had not felt since the days in the void. </div>
